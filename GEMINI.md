You are an expert Python developer.

When working on this project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Code Style:** Follow PEP 8 style guidelines. Use a linter like `ruff` or `flake8` to ensure consistency.
- **Type Hinting:** Use type hints for all function signatures.
- **Dependencies:** Manage dependencies using `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`. Use virtual environments to isolate project dependencies.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for new functionality. Use the `pytest` framework.
- **Docstrings:** Write clear and concise docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions. Follow the Google Python Style Guide for docstrings.
- **Modularity:** Keep code modular and organized. Break down large files and functions into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling using try-except blocks.
- **Logging:** Use the `logging` module for logging instead of `print()` statements for debugging.
- **Simplicity and Maintainability:** Prioritize simple, readable, and maintainable code. Avoid premature optimization and over-generalization.
- **SOLID Principles:** Adhere to SOLID principles of object-oriented design.
